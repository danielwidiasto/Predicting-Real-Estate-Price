Choosing a real estate investment is usually something that most individuals carefully consider before doing. Selecting the ideal property to invest in, given the myriad of considerations, is the most challenging aspect of choosing real estate. The purpose of this study is to determine if several regression models, including extreme gradient boost regression and random forest regression can effectively assist consumers in selecting the appropriate
attributes. To begin the experiment, a dataset of house characteristics and prices would need to be located and prepared. The next step in the procedure is to train the models in predetermined settings. According to the experiment, the random forest regression performed best in the 80:20 data split with an R2 value of 0.7375. It's also important to note that all models behaved consistently in every setting. In spite of the results, we think that the study would benefit from experimenting with different models or altering the dataset in order to get better outcomes.
